  <h2 class="post-title">Windows, Y U NO RESOLVE DNS</h2>
  <p class="post-meta">Jul 23, 2013</p>
  <p>This past weekend, I had some time to kill, so I decided to augment my DHCP server with a little DNS. I had been using a dedicated DHCP server for a while, just for kicks (and for learning dhcpd). A few of my machines already had fixed addresses in the dhcpd.conf for ease of access, so I thought the next step would be to add DNS entries. After all, nothing says awesome like typing “ssh laptop” and it working.</p>

<p>Fortunately, bind9’s default configuration (on Debian) forwards DNS requests for non-authoritative zones by default, so fifteen-minutes and a few whiskey sours later (if you can understand that config file format <em>without</em> a few drinks in you, you’re amazing), I had the configuration worked out and was resolving local network host names like a pro. I ssh’d into all of my servers, and life was good.</p>

<p>Until I booted Windows.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ping-redbase.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ugh. What is going on?</p>

<p>I fired up nslookup and typed in “redbase”. It couldn’t find the IP address. Remembering what little I know about FQDN’s, I then tried “redbase.” (with the period). Sure enough, it worked.</p>

<p>This is kind of strange since “ping redbase” and “nslookup redbase” worked in Linux, without the dot. Well, ipconfig says that my connection-specific DNS suffix is example.org (lol). On a hunch, I fired up Wireshark.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/redbase.example.org_.png" alt="Well, lookey here..." /></p>

<p>Sure enough, “nslookup redbase” causes Windows to try and resolve redbase.example.org. Maybe this is a good thing, I don’t know. From what I read online, the desired behavior is for a client to try “redbase.” first, then try “redbase.example.org.”. I guess Windows assumes that there won’t be any single-label DNS entries, although there doesn’t appear to be a rule against them. Typical nonstandard behavior. There’s a group policy behavior called “Allow DNS Suffix Appending to Unqualified Multi-Label Name Queries” (could that name be any longer?) that allows you to disable appending the connection-specific DNS, but I’m running Home Premium, so I don’t have Group Policy Editor. Figures. I found this <a href="http://gpsearch.azurewebsites.net/">awesome site</a> that converts group policies to registry keys; in this case, the key is “HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient” (UseDomainNameDevolution: DWORD). There’s only one problem: it doesn’t work. I chalked this up as caused by Home Premium as well.</p>

<p>So, for my final straw, I opened up dhcpd.conf and changed the connection-specific DNS from “example.org” to “.”. I renewed my DHCP, and sure enough…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/nslookup-redbase.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yes. Finally. Now, a final ping to put the nail in the coffin.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ping-redbase-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What? WHAT?!?! No. What is this, I don’t even. Go go Wireshark!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/llmnr.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Okay, so apparently ping, my web browser, and practically everything else only tries to resolve a LLMNR request. It doesn’t even <em>try</em> DNS! What the heck is up with that?</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, though, while msys SSH didn’t work at all when my suffix was example.org, it’s totally working now for “redbase”, even without the period. What the heck.</p>

<p>Windows can’t DNS. Well.</p>
